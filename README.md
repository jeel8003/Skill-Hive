## üìñ Overview

This is a feature-rich, full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) built from the ground up using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)[2]. The platform is designed to provide a seamless online learning experience, allowing students to browse, purchase, and track their progress in various courses, while instructors can create, manage, and publish their own content[2].

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end development cycle, from backend API creation to a dynamic, responsive frontend user interface[6]. It was developed to solidify full-stack development skills and serve as a comprehensive portfolio piece[2][7].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application follows a standard client-server architecture, with the frontend and backend decoupled for better maintainability and scalability[1].



## üöÄ Local Development Setup

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or yarn
*   MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jeel8003/LMS.git
    cd LMS
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables. Use the `.env.example` as a guide.
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the backend server URL:
    ```
    VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Navigate to the `server` directory and run:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    In a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application live.
